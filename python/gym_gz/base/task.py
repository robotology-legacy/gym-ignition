class Task(abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface to define a decision-making task.

    The Task is the central interface of each environment implementation.
    It defines the logic of the environment in a format that is agnostic of both the
    runtime (either simulated or real-time) and the models it operates on.

    :py:class:`~gym_gz.base.runtime.Runtime` instances are the real objects returned
    to the users when they call :py:class:`gym.make`. Depending on the type of the
    runtime, it could contain one or more :py:class:`Task` objects.
    The :py:class:`~gym_gz.base.runtime.Runtime` is a relay class that calls the
    logic of the :py:class:`Task` from its interface methods and implements the real
    :py:meth:`gym.Env.step`.
    Simulated runtimes step the physics engine, instead, real-time
    runtimes, enforce real-time execution.

    A :py:class:`Task` object is meant to be:

    - Independent from the selected :py:class:`~gym_gz.base.runtime.Runtime`.
      In fact, it defines only the decision making logic;
    - Independent from the :py:class:`~scenario.core.Model` objects it operates on.
      This is achieved thanks to the model abstraction provided by
      :cpp:class:`scenario::core::Model`.

    The population of the world where the task operates is demanded to a
    :py:class:`gym.Wrapper` object, that acts as an environment randomizer.

            using their URDF / SDF model to extract the information you need
            (e.g. number of DoFs, joint position limits, etc). Since actions and
            observations are often normalized, in many cases there's no need to extract
            a lot of information from the model file.
